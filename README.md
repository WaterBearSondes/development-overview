# WaterBear
Overview of the WaterBear open source development effort.  This document is a **Work In Progress**.

## Getting Started
Onboarding for contributors depends heavily on where you want to start.  Do you want to jump in an write code?  Are you more interested in building a sonde and getting data first?  We will dial this section in more and more, but in the meantime here are a few places you might start:

1. Buy necessary components and build the Ardunio Uno based platform
2. Build Android app in Android Studio to communicate with the device
3. Construct a case to do a test deployment in a water body or river
